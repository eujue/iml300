            <li>In Black Gooey Universe, American Artist states that developers have lost touch with the interests of their users. How does the commercialization of technology contribute to this?

          <ol>
            <li>Although memes are a powerful agent of protest, propaganda, politics, and culture, why and how do we become desensitized to certain media? Is desensitization a positive and/or a negative?

      <div id = "b-2a">
          
          <ol>
            <li>In the article “Afro-now-ism” by Stephanie Dinkins, the author states that “humans have the responsibility to re-conceive the systems that threaten communities rendered simultaneously hyper-visible and invisible by their perceived difference.” As creators, how can we use our skills and our privilege to empower those who are “simultaneously hyper-visible and invisible”?
              </li>
              <br>
              <li> How do we put inclusion at the forefront of our work? How do we encourage others to do the same?
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Stephanie Dinkins mentions the need to “reimagine human supremacy.” What are some steps we can take to make this re-imagination into a reality – something that we can dismantle and disrupt?

      <div id = "b-2a">
          
          <ol>
            <li>In the Ted Talk “The Danger of a Single Story” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the speaker talks about the dangers associated with a single story. As media makers and storytellers, whose story should we tell? Whose narratives do we get to tell?
              </li>
              <br>
              <li> In the reading, “How to Write Non-Violent Creative Code” by Olivia Ross, the author drafted a set of guidelines, questions, and prompts for us to consider in our own body of work. How can we continually consider these prompts at the forefront of our work? 
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Yaa Addae states that a component of data healing is to “prioritize love over likes.” This quote reminded me of Instagram recently pushing beta versions of what the social media platform would look like without likes––would this instance be a step towards love, towards data healing?
              </li>
