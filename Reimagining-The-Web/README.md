# Gradient Emotions
![demo](https://github.com/eujue/iml300/blob/master/Reimagining-The-Web/asset/demo.gif)

A Google Chrome extension buddy that can match to how you are feeling. As humans, we have very complex emotions and it's important to stay in touch with how we are feeling at the time. I hope that this Chrome extensions helps everyone stay aware of how they feel. Made with p5.js

### Next Steps
I hope to come back to this Google Chrome Extension project and include more emojis that users can identify with. Like the description of this extension mentions, as humans, we have very complex emotions (that's why there are 3,304 emojis!) and the 6 emojis that I currently have do not compare to the real emotions of an individual. I also hope to create subtle transitions between clicks for the gradients so the background colors are soothing to the eyes.

### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
1. **Colors of the Day**
Based on the time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, night), the background displays a soft gradient color with minimalistic illustrations/animations on the screen to help users stay mindful

2. **Stand Up!**
A friendly reminder that fills up your screen so you stand up and stretch at certain time intervals

3. **Word Remover**
All the words on your screen are removed and you’re only left with the author’s punctuation

4. **Color Contrast Checker**
A color checker that notifies when and where you’re using colors that are not web accessible
