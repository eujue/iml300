### Other Chrome extension concepts I am interested in creating
* **Colors of the Day**
Based on the time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, night), the background displays a soft gradient color with minimalistic illustrations/animations on the screen to help users stay mindful
* **Stand Up!**
A friendly reminder that fills up your screen so you stand up and stretch at certain time intervals
* **Word Remover**
All the words on your screen are removed and you’re only left with the author’s punctuation
* **Color Contrast Checker**
A color checker that notifies when and where you’re using colors that are not web accessible
